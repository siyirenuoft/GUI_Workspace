    the function takes in a high sample rate produce signal, extract high frequency components using STFT, and extract low frequency components using Hilbert transform
    Input: 
        product_signal: the input signal with very high sample rate
        sample_rate: the sample rate of the input signal, e.g., 44100 Hz
        downsample_rate: the expected output sample rate for vibration commands,, e.g., 200 Hz
    Output: 
        high_freq_signal: a numpy array of the high frequency components (range [100, 400]), used for setting the frequency of vibration commands (find the nearest frequency out of the eight options)
        low_freq_signal: a numpy array of the low frequency components (range [0, 1]), used for setting the intensity of vibration commands (map to [0, 15])
